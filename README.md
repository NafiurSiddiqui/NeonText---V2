## :bug: BUGS from v1

---

- unpredictable behaviour for the computed style of the height, needs double clicking to render the accurate size.

## Solution to bugs

---

Fixed.

### Some of the technical aspect i have implemented in this version of the webApp (almost)

---
- React (no third party libs)

- React Router

- SASS.

- Debouncing algorithm -- to save resources and time therefore good optimization and speed. ( i have a custom debounce hook here which is not used here but left for reference for next updates)

- One of the most trickiest and challenging part was to get the height of each characters, which i did with the help of masking a canvas.

- Dynamic calculation of price and dimensions.

- Dynamic mapping of colors to set the neon color

- Allows user to select between given fonts and render accurate data.

- Caching with local storage to reassure user gets the text, dimension, price where they left in case they close or refresh the tab.

- Algortihtm for checking local storage availibility

- Responsiveness ensured which adapts to all of the devices out there.
